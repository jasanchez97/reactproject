--- About the project ---

This project has been inspired by one of my favorite games, as a practical vision pursuing a dream that I am about to fulfill.


--- Built with ---

Microsoft Visual Studio
React
JavaScript


--- Getting started ---

    -- Prerequisites

        First of all you need a device to be able to work and store the project without having any problem working on it.

        After this you will obviously need the internet to download the required programs below:

        - Microsoft Visual Studio -> "https://code.visualstudio.com/"

        - Node.js -> "https://nodejs.org/es/download"

        - Git -> "https://git-scm.com/downloads/win"

        Once you download successfully these two programs you may start to build locally the project.

    
    -- Installation

        Open the git Bash terminal and create a new repository in GitHub to make a secure/safe version of the project in case that something go wrong.
        You should do another branch for experimental tests and stay there (developer).

        Once you did, with the correct directory in visual studio do the next command:

        npm create vite@latest

        - Set the name of the project
        - Select the framework (React)
        - And the variant (JavaScript)

        cd the project name and then do "npm install"

        Wait a couple of seconds to give time for the installation, it may take a while.

        npm install react-router-dom , a package essential to work with.

        If everything is in order you should not have any vulnerability or problem as a result shown in the terminal.

--- Usage ---

    This project is a perfect example to start promoting a game that you or your team has created, it is a good start to learning how to develop your own.

    With React you can work easily and more efficient that using HTML 5, is some complex but the learning curve doesnt be an inconvenient after you start to make your own way.

    And then you will be able to see its fruits.

--- Contributing ---

    Open source community is the best you can have to learn web developer, as the internet itself too with some filter types that you need to know when to apply it.

    And that's where you come in, if you want to contribute, as always, in gratitude, any contribution that you consider making, a simple opinion can be very useful even if it doesn't seem like it.
